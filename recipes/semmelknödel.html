        <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>"Semmelknödel," also known as bread dumplings, are a traditional Bavarian dish popular in German-speaking regions. These delectable dumplings are made from stale bread cubes combined with milk, eggs, and seasonings, then formed into round balls and boiled until fluffy and tender. The result is a comforting and hearty side dish with a soft, pillowy texture and a rich, savory flavor.

Semmelknödel are often served alongside hearty meat dishes such as roasts or stews, where they soak up the flavorful sauces and juices, adding depth to each bite. They are also enjoyed as a standalone dish, sometimes topped with melted butter or gravy for added indulgence.

The preparation of Semmelknödel varies slightly from household to household, with some recipes incorporating ingredients like onions, parsley, or bacon for added flavor. Regardless of the variations, Semmelknödel are cherished for their comforting taste and are a beloved staple of Bavarian cuisine.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the bread rolls into small cubes or thin slices.</li>
                <li>Sauté the chopped parsley and onion in butter very briefly, without letting them take on any color, then mix them with the bread cubes.</li>
                <li>Heat the milk until just before boiling and pour it over the bread cubes. Let it soak for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs whisked with salt and pepper to the mixture, and stir everything together to form a not too firm dough. If the dough is too soft, incorporate some breadcrumbs - do not use flour.</li>
                <li>With wet hands, shape tennis ball-sized dumplings and let them simmer in gently boiling liquid (salted water or broth) for 20 minutes until they float to the top and are cooked through.</li>
                <li>Semmelknödel (bread dumplings) are the perfect side dish for goulash, roast pork, or braised mushrooms.</li>
