        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Margherita pizza is a classic Italian dish known for its simplicity and fresh, high-quality ingredients. It features a
        thin, crisp yet slightly chewy crust, traditionally baked in a wood-fired oven to achieve a perfect balance of crunchy
        and tender. The base of the pizza is lightly coated with a vibrant tomato sauce, made from ripe, crushed tomatoes that
        are seasoned with salt, and sometimes garlic and herbs, creating a rich and slightly tangy foundation.</p>
